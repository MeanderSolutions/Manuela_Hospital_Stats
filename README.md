 PowerBi
 
PowerBI project (Datacamp)

In this project I analysed Hospital Performance and Benchmarking. 

I was exploring the following insights:
•	Which hospitals stand out with highest cost and LOS (longevity of stay) relative to the state average?
•	Which hospitals stand out as biggest outliers overall?
•	Does larger surgical program size impact LOS and cost?
•	Root cause analysis: what factors influence LOS and cost the most?

While exploring, I had in mind the following factors of hospital efficiency:
•	Safety (avoiding harm to patients from the care that should help them) 
•	Effectiveness (how well a healthcare service achieves its intended purpose)
•	Timeliness (reducing delays for both those who receive and those who give care)
•	Patient – Centered (providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values)
•	Equity (providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics)
•	Efficiency (avoiding waist, including waist of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy)

I measured hospital efficiency through:
•	Average LOS days
•	Average cost per discharge

Key insights uncovered:
•	Average cost per discharge: $ 21,000
•	Top influencers increasing average LOS and cost:
-	Extreme illness severity
-	Extreme / Major mortality risk
-	Hospitals in New York City
-	Patients disposition to skilled nursing home
